# UniProject8-GaussianPlumeModelling

The Gaussian Plume Model is based on the assumptions that the distribution of pollutant concentrations at different distances from the source follow a Gaussian distribution; the model estimates steate state solutions at various distances from the source, for different wind velocities, different chimney heights and different atmospheric conditions.
